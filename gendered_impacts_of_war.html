            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This section examines the various ways in which war affects men and women differently. It explores themes such as the impact of sexual violence, the roles of women as caretakers during and after conflict, and the long-term psychological effects of war on different genders.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Sexual Violence as a Weapon of War</h2>
            <p>Sexual violence has been used as a weapon of war to terrorize and destabilize communities. Women and girls are often the primary targets, suffering horrific abuses that have lasting physical and psychological impacts. This form of violence is not just a byproduct of war, but a deliberate strategy used by combatants to exert control and power.
                During the Liberia Conflict in 2004, many women and young girls fell victim to many forms of sexual assault in the military. 
                <blockquote>
                    "In a February 2004 report, How to Fight, How to Kill: Child Soldiers in Liberia, Human Rights Watch
                    described how all three parties to the conflict misused girls... Sex on demand was often required to “boost the boys’ morale,” and 
                    many girls were sexually assaulted to the point of death... Strict rules governed sexual relations between children and youth in the LURD units, but these were
                    specifically directed at containing girls’ sexuality. The rules prohibited young women from trying to
                    have sexual relations with a friend’s boyfriend, and also barred women from having two boyfriends at
                    the same time. While many women ex-combatants reported surviving sexual violence at the hands of both the LURD
                    and forces associated with Charles Taylor’s regime prior to joining the WAC, they were, in turn, capable of facilitating sexual violence against women. One woman interviewed by Human Rights Watch
                    said that she and other female soldiers purposefully captured female prisoners in order to provide
                    women for male soldiers to have sexual relations with, whether through choice or by force. The girl
                    soldiers described how they sought out female prisoners in order to provide a different target for possible rape and other sexual assaults from their male companions."  - UNIFEM, 2004
                </blockquote>

                Another prominent example is in the Guatemalan genocide, where sexual violence was systematically orchestrated by high-ranking officials and shielded from accountability through official denial. The vast majority (94.3%) of reported cases of sexual violence against women were perpetrated by army soldiers and security officers. Shockingly, one-third of the reported rape victims were minor girls. Survivors of these atrocities endured severe physical and psychological consequences, including pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and the enduring social stigma associated with rape. Female witnesses bravely recounted their experiences of being gang-raped by army soldiers during court proceedings, prompting solidarity gestures from indigenous women who covered their heads with shawls. One witness, Elena de Paz Santiago, recounted in court the horrific ordeal she endured as a child at the hands of Guatemalan soldiers, vividly describing the brutality she faced. The prosecution's decision to call witnesses like Ms. de Paz Santiago suggests a significant shift in international legal practice, highlighting the systematic use of sexual violence as a genocide strategy. While sexual violence in conflict has historically been explained as an unfortunate consequence of war, this narrative is no longer sustainable. Efforts by entities such as the International Criminal Court, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, feminist scholars, and human rights advocates have reframed sexual violence as an integral aspect of wartime strategy, with women's bodies being targeted as crucial sites of conflict.

            <h2>Psychological Effects of War</h2>
            <p>The psychological impacts of war differ across genders, with men and women experiencing trauma in unique ways. While men might struggle with the stigma of vulnerability and emotional expression, women often face the compounded stress of violence, displacement, and caregiving responsibilities. Understanding 
                these differences is crucial for providing effective mental health support in post-conflict settings.
                The mental health consequences of sexual violence can also be debilitating,
particularly if rape is accompanied by extreme violence or torture or if the
rape is done in front of or by family members or neighbors, as happens in
some conflicts. In Sierra Leone, for example, a common pattern of attack
involved forcing parents or children to watch or even participate in the rape
of women and girls in their own families or villages. This was carried out as a
way to terrorize the community and to impart maximum trauma on family
members. The following video details some of the experiences, feelings and trauma of sexual violence in Guatemala:

                During war, men are more likely to be killed because they are often the primary combatants. Historically and culturally, men are typically enlisted or conscripted into armed forces, placing them directly on the front lines of conflict. The roles and expectations of masculinity often drive men to take up arms, leading to higher casualty rates among them. This direct exposure to combat zones means men are disproportionately affected by the immediate violence of war, including fatalities, injuries, and the psychological toll of fighting.

                However, the impact of war extends beyond the battlefield, profoundly affecting women and children who are often left behind. As men are drawn into combat, women and children face displacement, becoming refugees as they flee from war-torn areas in search of safety. The displacement process exposes them to numerous risks, including lack of access to basic necessities like food, water, and shelter. Refugee camps and temporary settlements often lack adequate security and resources, leading to increased vulnerability to exploitation, trafficking, and gender-based violence. Moreover, the disruption of social structures and support systems further compounds their suffering, making it harder for them to rebuild their lives during and after the conflict.

                The gendered impact of war highlights the interconnected nature of these experiences, where the direct involvement of men in combat indirectly but severely affects women and children. Addressing these multifaceted consequences requires comprehensive policies that consider the specific needs and vulnerabilities of all affected populations, ensuring that humanitarian aid and post-conflict recovery efforts are inclusive and effective.
                <blockquote>
                    "Families are forced to split up, disperse,
                    enter into refugee or internally displaced person (IDP) camps and to develop
                    alternative ways of earning a living which can result in unhealthy consequences and outcomes... Displacement creates even more radical ruptures of long-established
                    community relationships. For example, organizations working with women
                    in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon note that one of the most lasting
                    impacts of resettlement on Palestinian families is the destruction of their support networks, which previously allowed families and communities to have a
                    level of social insurance when they fell on hard times... Women also make decisions to distribute scarce resources among their
                    families, to stay in homes in conflict zones, or to flee to refugee camps or
                    neighboring states. Some women choose to cooperate with insurgent groups
                    for reasons ranging from political and ideological commitments to their own
                    assessments that cooperation is the best way to ensure their physical security
                    and/or their children’s." - Women and the Political Economy of War, pg 42
