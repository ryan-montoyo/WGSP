            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The involvement of women in war has been a multifaceted phenomenon, spanning various roles and contexts throughout history. From active combatants to caregivers and support staff, women have made significant contributions to military endeavors, challenging traditional gender norms and shaping the course of conflicts. This section explores the diverse roles women have played in wars across different epochs and geographies, highlighting their resilience, agency, and impact on the battlefield and beyond. Additionally, we examine the portrayal of women in war within media narratives, exploring the evolution of gender representations and the ongoing quest for authentic and inclusive storytelling. Through these explorations, we seek to understand the complexities of women's experiences in times of conflict and their enduring legacy in the annals of history.

            <h2>Women in Combat</h2>
            <p>Throughout history, women have served in combat roles, often challenging traditional gender norms. For example, Lyudmila Pavlichenko, one of the most successful snipers in history, served in the Soviet Army during World War II. Despite societal expectations, women like her have demonstrated exceptional bravery and skill on the battlefield.

                <br>
                Another example lies in the conflict in Liberia. Women and girls actively participated in every stage of the most recent armed conflict in Liberia as
                combatants, as supporters, as peace-builders and as political actors. Women and girls joined the
                ranks of armed groups both involuntarily and voluntarily in order to survive harsh economic conditions or because they believed in the cause for which a particular side was fighting. In total, women
                and children are thought to have comprised up to 38 per cent of the 38,000 to 53,000 total Liberian
                combatants eligible for DDR in 2004. Initial estimates of the number of women combatants ranged
                from 1,000 to 10,000, but as of August 2004, 12,000 have already gone through the DDR process.

            <h2>Roles as Nurses and Support Staff</h2>
            <p>Throughout history, women have played integral yet often overlooked roles in supporting military endeavors. In the 19th century, during periods of industrialization and colonial expansion, women were frequently involved in logistical support roles such as nursing, caregiving, and provision of supplies to troops. The Crimean War (1853-1856) witnessed a remarkable surge in the involvement of women as volunteer nurses, with many displaying remarkable dedication and courage in the face of adversity. For instance, as detailed in Pride and Prejudice: Ladies and Nurses in the Crimean War: 
            <blockquote>
                “Miss Clough was one of these. She joined the party, by her own admission, more for sentimental than philanthropic reasons. She wished to visit the grave at Devna of her officer sweetheart...She was the only woman to nurse in a regimental hospital during the war...She died there in September 1855 of prolonged fevers and diarrhea” - A. Summers, pg 37 
            </blockquote>                
            Similarly, Jane Shaw Stewart, with professional training and a keen interest in healthcare, served as superintendent of hospitals at Balaklava and later at the military general hospital at Woolwich, despite facing numerous challenges and pressures. Frances Margaret Taylor, the youngest among the nursing cohort, displayed exceptional compassion and resilience, drawing from her experiences in aiding the poor during the cholera outbreak of 1849 to provide care for soldiers during the war. These women, along with others, defied societal expectations and overcame personal obstacles to serve on the frontlines, showcasing the evolving roles of women in wartime endeavors. Their contributions not only revolutionized medical practices but also challenged prevailing gender norms, paving the way for subsequent generations of women to assert their agency in conflict settings.

            <h2>Women in War... in Media</h2>
            <p>
                In media, particularly in war movies and related narratives, the portrayal of women in wartime settings has often been characterized by certain recurring themes and stereotypes. Traditionally, women have been depicted in supporting roles, such as nurses or caregivers, rather than as active participants in combat. When they are shown in combat roles, their representation tends to conform to gendered expectations, often emphasizing their vulnerability or reliance on male counterparts for protection. However, there has been a gradual shift in recent years towards more diverse and complex portrayals of women in war media. Films like "Wonder Woman" and "Captain Marvel" have challenged traditional gender norms by presenting female protagonists as powerful warriors who can hold their own on the battlefield. Despite these advancements, there is still a long way to go in achieving gender parity and accurate representation of women's experiences in war media. It is crucial for media creators to continue pushing boundaries and telling diverse stories that reflect the full spectrum of women's contributions and experiences in times of conflict. However, even groundbreaking portrayals like Wonder Woman have faced controversy, particularly regarding the sexualization of the protagonist's costume, underscoring the ongoing challenges in depicting women in war media authentically and respectfully.
