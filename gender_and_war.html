            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This section examines the roles of women in terrorist activities and counter-terrorism efforts. Topics include the strategic use of women as suicide bombers, gender-specific recruitment tactics by terrorist organizations, and the importance of incorporating gender perspectives in counter-terrorism strategies. Currently, women are on the frontlines of violent extremism, participating in various roles such as recruiters, propagators, suicide bombers, and targets. Additionally, women are also emerging as leaders working on de-radicalisation, counter-messaging, and peacebuilding. This duality highlights the complex and multifaceted involvement of women in terrorism and counter-terrorism efforts.

            <h2>Women as Suicide Bombers</h2>
            <p>The phenomenon of women suicide bombers represents a profound departure from conventional gender norms within the context of warfare. Historically, societal perceptions have relegated women to roles as nurturers and caregivers, positioning them on the periphery of conflict rather than as active participants on the front lines. However, extremist groups have demonstrated a strategic adaptability by exploiting these gendered norms to their advantage. Women, traditionally perceived as less threatening and more inconspicuous, are increasingly recruited by terrorist organizations to carry out suicide attacks. This recruitment strategy capitalizes on the perception of women as innocent and non-threatening, allowing them to circumvent security measures more effectively. 
                <blockquote>
                    “The condensation between the rhetoric of technology and nature in the construction of woman as weapon is even more dramatic in British and American media reports of Palestinian women suicide bombers. A news story in the London Sunday Times describing the frequency of suicide bombings by Palestinian women begins:“They are anonymous in veils, but when they go out to kill they may be disguised with a ponytail and a pretty smile. . . . Israel’s new nightmare: female suicide-bombers more deadly than the male”; the reporter goes on to call them Palestine’s secret weapon” - K. Oliver, pg 6

                The rise of women suicide bombers underscores the evolving nature of warfare in the modern era, where traditional distinctions between combatants and civilians are increasingly blurred. Moreover, it challenges the prevailing narrative of women as passive victims of conflict, highlighting their agency and capacity for violent action within the context of extremist ideologies. As such, understanding the motivations and mechanisms behind the recruitment of women as suicide bombers is crucial for addressing the multifaceted nature of contemporary security threats. </p>

            <h2>Gender-Specific Recruitment Tactics</h2>
            <p>Terrorist groups often employ gender-specific recruitment tactics to attract women. These tactics can include promises of 
                empowerment, adventure, and a sense of belonging, as well as exploiting personal grievances and socio-economic factors.
                Sanam Naraghi Anderlini provides some insight into these recruitment tactics in her article "Challenging Conventional Wisdom,
                Transforming Current Practices
                A Gendered Lens on PVE." 

                <blockquote>
                    "There is also deliberate outreach and recruitment of women...They are often motivated by their need to assert agency and garner respect for contributing to a
                    greater – preferably just – cause. Many also join to avenge crimes committed against them by state actors,
                    or abuses suffered by their families and male relatives...  In Pakistan, Paiman Trust identifies, engages and deradicalises women affiliated with extremist groups. Many of them earn incomes
                    sewing suicide belts, believing that they are thus fulfilling their religious duty.
                    Quality of life is a clear enticement in other settings too. Among some women affiliated with Boko
                    Haram, there has been reluctance to leave the movement. As one woman noted, she had ‘slaves’ who
                    “washed, cooked, and babysat for her”. Another woman interviewed was also frank about the benefits.
                    “There was 100% better treatment as a wife under Boko Haram. There were more gifts, better food, and
                    a lot of sex that I always enjoyed.” For those who had never had access to any education, the mandatory
                    Quran classes were welcome as an opportunity to learn." - Sanam Naraghi Anderlini, <i>pgs 10-11</i>
                    
                </blockquote>

                Sanam Naraghi Anderlini’s quote provides a nuanced look into the multifaceted motivations behind women joining extremist groups and the complex socio-economic and psychological factors involved. She states, "There is also deliberate outreach and recruitment of women...They are often motivated by their need to assert agency and garner respect for contributing to a greater – preferably just – cause. Many also join to avenge crimes committed against them by state actors, or abuses suffered by their families and male relatives." This highlights that women's involvement is not simply about coercion or manipulation; it often stems from a deep-seated desire for agency and recognition, as well as personal vendettas against injustices they or their loved ones have endured.
                <br> <br>In Pakistan, organizations like Paiman Trust play a crucial role in identifying and deradicalizing women affiliated with extremist groups. These women often engage in activities such as sewing suicide belts, believing they are fulfilling their religious duties. This indicates that the intersection of economic necessity and religious fervor can be a potent recruitment tool.
                <br><br>Additionally, for women who had never accessed education, the mandatory Quran classes provided by these groups were seen as valuable opportunities to learn. This underscores the point that extremist groups often fill voids left by the state or society, providing education, a sense of purpose, and community to marginalized individuals.

                A new study by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation has found that thousands of women and minors were among those who joined ISIS and that those numbers have been significantly underestimated until now. Experts have also warned that returning women and minors linked to the terrorist group pose a significant threat.

                In total, the report details 41,490 people who travelled to join ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Of that total, 4,761 (13 percent) were women while 4,640 (12 percent) were minors. 7,366 of those 41,490 have returned home and 79 percent of those returnees are male. 256 of them, 4 percent, are women while 1,180 or 17 percent are minors.

            <h2>Gender Perspectives in Counter-Terrorism</h2> <br>
            <figure style="text-align: center;">

            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>Sanam Naraghi Anderlini also highlights the pivotal role women-led organizations play in combating violent extremism by promoting peace and security through alternative, inclusive interpretations of religious texts and community visions. These organizations, deeply embedded in their communities, leverage their local trust and understanding of cultural nuances to offer non-violent, pluralistic approaches that challenge extremist ideologies. Despite their potential, these efforts are often hampered by limited resources, shrinking civil society spaces, and a lack of recognition from international policy circles. Women’s rights defenders and peace activists, who were among the first to recognize and respond to the rise of extremism, continue to face significant obstacles, including attacks from national security apparatuses and marginalization within the broader peace and security discourse. Their initiatives, which combine religious literacy, psycho-social support, and skills training, provide valuable alternatives for young men susceptible to radicalization. However, the international community often fails to integrate these perspectives into mainstream PVE (Preventing Violent Extremism) efforts, further complicated by a narrative from Western scholars that undermines the agency and innovation of these women-led groups. This marginalization underscores the need for greater acknowledgment and support for women’s contributions to peacebuilding and de-radicalization efforts.</p>
